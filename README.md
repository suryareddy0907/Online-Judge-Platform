## ü§ñ AI-Powered Features

- **Smart Hint Generation:**
  - Uses Cohere API to generate concise, actionable hints based on the problem statement and user code.
  - Requires `COHERE_API_KEY` in your server `.env` file.

- **Code Analysis/Feedback:**
  - Uses Cohere API to provide concise, numbered feedback on user code for a given problem.
  - Requires `CODE_ANALYSIS_KEY` in your server `.env` file.

- **Problem Statement Explanation:**
  - Uses Cohere API to restate the problem in simpler, beginner-friendly language (no hints or solutions).
  - Requires `PROBLEM_EXPLAIN_KEY` in your server `.env` file.

- **Time and Space Complexity Analysis:**
  - Uses OpenRouter API (Mistral 7B Instruct model) to analyze the code written in the editor and provide a concise summary (5-10 lines) of its time and space complexity.
  - Requires `BOILERPLATE_KEY` (OpenRouter API key) in your server `.env` file.

- **Code Debugging:**
  - Uses OpenRouter API (Mistral 7B Instruct model) to pinpoint and concisely explain all types of errors (syntax, runtime, logic, performance, semantic/design) in user code, referencing only the problematic lines (no code output).
  - Requires `DEBUG_KEY` (OpenRouter API key) in your server `.env` file.

**Note:**
- All AI features are accessible via dedicated buttons on the problem details page, including the new "Generate Time and Space Complexities" button.
- Each feature requires the corresponding API key to be set in your server `.env` file.
- The backend will return clear error messages if an API key is missing or invalid.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- MongoDB
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd online-judge
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

#### Server Dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Client Dependencies
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

#### Online Compiler Dependencies
```bash
cd ../online-compiler
npm install
```

### 3. Create Compiler Directories (Required)

**This is a mandatory step.** Before running the application, you must manually create two folders inside the `online-compiler` directory:

1.  `codes`: This folder temporarily stores the source code files for compilation.
2.  `outputs`: This folder temporarily stores the compiled executables.

After creating them, your `online-compiler` directory should look like this:
```
online-compiler/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ codes/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ outputs/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (other files)
```

### 4. Environment Configuration

#### Server Environment (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/online-judge
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-here
```

#### Client Environment (.env)
Create a `.env` file in the `client` directory:
```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```
- For production, set `VITE_API_URL` to your deployed backend URL (e.g., `https://your-backend.com/api`).
- All client API calls will use this variable, so you never need to hardcode URLs.

### 5. Initialize the Default Admin User

Run the admin initialization script to create the default admin user:
```bash
cd server
npm run init-admin
```

This will create a default admin user with:
- **Email**: suryareddy0907@gmail.com
- **Password**: admin123
- **Role**: admin

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Change the default password after first login!

### 6. Start the Application

You must run the three services in separate terminals.

#### Start the Server
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

#### Start the Client
```bash
cd ../client
npm run dev
```

#### Start the Online Compiler
```bash
cd ../online-compiler
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:5173
- **Backend**: http://localhost:5000
- **Compiler Service**: http://localhost:5001

## üè† Home Page Stats

The home page displays the following dynamic stats:
- **Published Problems:** Total number of published problems.
- **My Submissions:** Total number of submissions made by the currently logged-in user (shows 0 if not logged in).
- **Registered Users:** Total number of users on the platform.
- **Active/Upcoming Contests:** Contests that are currently active or will happen in the future.

## üîê Admin Access

### Default Admin Credentials
- **Email**: suryareddy0907@gmail.com
- **Password**: admin123

### Admin Panel Access
1. Login with the admin credentials
2. Click on the "Admin Panel" button in the navigation
3. Access all admin features through the sidebar navigation

2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the server: `npm start`

### Online Compiler Deployment
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the service: `npm start`

### Frontend Deployment
1. Build the project: `npm run build`
2. Deploy the `dist` folder to your hosting service

## üñ•Ô∏è Online Compiler Microservice

This project includes a dedicated microservice for secure, isolated code compilation and execution.

### **How It Works**

1. **Frontend**: User writes code and clicks "Run".
2. **Main Backend**: Receives the code via `/api/run`, then forwards it to the compiler microservice.
3. **Compiler Microservice** (`online-compiler/`):
    - Receives code and language.
    - Saves code to a temporary file.
    - Compiles and executes the code (e.g., using `g++` for C++).
    - Captures output or errors (including `stderr` for compilation/runtime errors).
    - Returns the result to the main backend.
4. **Main Backend**: Forwards the output/error to the frontend.
5. **Frontend**: Displays the output or error in the output box.

### **Directory Structure**

```
online-compiler/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js           # Express server for code execution
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generateFile.js    # Utility to create temp code files
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ executeCpp.js      # Logic to compile and run C++ code
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
```
### **Setup Instructions**

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd online-compiler
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start the compiler microservice:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   By default, it runs on port `5001`.

3. **Ensure your main backend is running and configured to forward `/api/run` requests to `http://localhost:5001/run`.**

### **Security Note**
- The compiler microservice should **never be exposed to the public internet**.
- Always run it in a secure, isolated environment.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Code Execution API

### **Frontend Usage Example**

```js
const handleRun = async () => {
  const response = await axios.post('http://localhost:5000/api/run', {
    code: userCode,
    language: 'cpp', // or 'python', etc.
  });
  setOutput(response.data.output);
};
```

### **Backend Route Example**

- **POST `/api/run`**
  - Request body: `{ code: string, language: string }`
  - Response: `{ output: string }` (includes program output or compilation/runtime errors)

## üìù Error Output Handling

- Compilation and runtime errors are captured and returned in the `output` field.
- The frontend displays only the relevant error messages, filtering out internal file paths for a clean user experience.
- Long error messages wrap and scroll vertically in the output box.

## ‚ö° Quick Start (All Services)

```bash
# 1. Start MongoDB (if not already running)
mongod

# 2. Start the compiler microservice
cd online-compiler
npm install
npm start

# 3. Start the backend server
cd ../server
npm install
npm run dev

# 4. Start the frontend
cd ../client
npm install
npm run dev
```
